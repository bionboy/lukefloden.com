<img width="600" height="3188" alt="About page of lukefloden.com. The text is as follows: I want the internet to feel like it did 10 years ago. I am nostalgic for an era of the internet that I was too young to be apart of. Focused on actually connecting and sharing with each other. Fostering relationships and providing access to the tools and knowledge to grow. I want the internet to make our lives better; not to treat our attention as a resource. That being said.... here are my socials! " src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cdfbec3-74f3-40fc-85eb-91784037b703" />
