			<strong>I want the internet to feel like it did 10 years ago.</strong>
			I am nostalgic for an era of the internet that I was too young to be apart of. Focused on actually
			connecting and sharing with each other. Fostering relationships and providing access to the tools
			and knowledge to grow. I want the internet to make our lives better; not to treat our attention
			as a resource.

		<h3>This Site</h3>
		<!-- TODO: add a popup that shows an image of my old site on hover or click of "last iteration" -->
		<p>
			I started working on this site because my <strong>last iteration</strong> was years ago and
			nothing really more than a "linktree" or virtual business card. Not really something that
			reflects my sentiments <a href="#nostalgia">above</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			I've used this as an opportunity to finally dive into new tools, frameworks, utilities, and
			concepts that I previously was not able to (<em>ie. in a commercial environment</em>). Some of
			those being (but not exhaustive):

			<li>
				<a href="/portfolio/shaders">Shaders</a>: GLSL,
				<a href="https://thebookofshaders.com/">the book of shaders</a>, Svader

			<li>Svelte 5, SvelteKit</li>
			<li>OKLCH color space</li>
			<li>Shadcn UI (<em>Svelte specific version</em>)</li>

		<h3>LilyGem</h3>
		<p>
			<a href="https://lilygem.vercel.app/">
				<strong>LilyGem</strong>
			</a>
			is a personal finance companion that goes beyond simple currency conversion. I built this as a
			real-world application to solve the problem of tracking international transfers and understanding
			exchange rate patterns over time.
