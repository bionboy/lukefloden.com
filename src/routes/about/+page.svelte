			connecting and sharing with each other. Fostering relationships and providing access to the tools
			and knowledge to grow. I want the internet to make our lives better; not to treat our attention
			as a resource.

		<h3>This Site</h3>
		<!-- TODO: add a popup that shows an image of my old site on hover or click of "last iteration" -->
		<p>
			I started working on this site because my <strong>last iteration</strong> was years ago and
			nothing really more than a "linktree" or virtual business card. Not really something that
			reflects my sentiments <a href="#nostalgia">above</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			I've used this as an opportunity to finally dive into new tools, frameworks, utilities, and
			concepts that I previously was not able to (<em>ie. in a commercial environment</em>). Some of
			those being (but not exhaustive):
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="/portfolio/shaders">Shaders</a>: GLSL,
				<a href="https://thebookofshaders.com/">the book of shaders</a>, Svader
			</li>
			<li>Svelte 5, SvelteKit</li>
			<li>OKLCH color space</li>
			<li>Shadcn UI (<em>Svelte specific version</em>)</li>
			<li>...</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>LilyGem</h3>
		<p>
			<a href="https://lilygem.vercel.app/">
				<strong>LilyGem</strong>
			</a>
			is a personal finance companion that goes beyond simple currency conversion. I built this as a
			real-world application to solve the problem of tracking international transfers and understanding
			exchange rate patterns over time.
		</p>
		<p>
			The app features real-time currency conversion, historical rate analysis, transaction
			tracking, and a custom WebGL shader background that creates dynamic color gradients. It's
			designed to help users make informed decisions about when to exchange currencies based on
			historical trends.
		</p>
		<p>
			This project gave me hands-on experience with several technologies and concepts I wanted to
			explore in a production environment:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Next.js 15</strong> with React 19 and the new Turbopack dev server
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Authentication</strong>: NextAuth v5 with Google OAuth and Supabase adapter
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Database</strong>: Supabase with Row Level Security (RLS)
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Overcoming API data limitations</strong>: Automated exchange rate fetching with cron
				jobs and smart caching for historical data
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Data Visualization</strong>: Interactive historical exchange rate charts using
				<a href="https://recharts.org/">Recharts</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>WebGL Shaders</strong>: Custom fragment shader background with noise-based color
				palettes
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Modern UI</strong>: Shadcn/UI components with glassmorphism effects
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Type Safety</strong>: Full TypeScript implementation with Zod schema validation
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>State Management</strong>: TanStack Query for server state with optimistic updates
			</li>
		</ul>
